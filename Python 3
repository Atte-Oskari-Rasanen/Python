y=x[:];
even if x=y, now they are called different - they become different objects 
if y=x --- TRUE
but y is x ---- FALSE


As you progress, you should keep saving scripts, commands etc that are needed

enumerate() a useful function besides else, if etc 
   - gives both an index and the corresponding item
Raise() function to tell python about errors, for example that you cannot have negative children or B in the DNA. 

num_of_children=-1
if num_of_children < 0:
    raise Exception('Number of children cannot be negative')
    
Another function to make sure your code is robust
You can try if something is true with try() and thus, contain the error instead of ending
    while True:
    try:
        x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")
        
  Raise() and try() (along with except()) should be applied in your code to make sure that your code cannot be broken 
  
x=0; y=1; t=0 sum_t=0 while t<1000: t = x+y; x=y; y=t; if t%2==0: sum_t = sum_t+t; print(sum_t)
