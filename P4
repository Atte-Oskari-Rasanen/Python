File Modes in Python

Following are various modes in Python
Mode 	Description
'r' 	This is the default mode. It Opens file for reading.
'w' 	This Mode Opens file for writing.   -- this erases the contents of the file if there's any before opening it on python!
'x' 	Creates a new file. If file already exists, the operation fails.
'a' 	Open file in append mode.
If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
't' 	This is the default mode. It opens in text mode.
'b' 	This opens in binary mode.
'+' 	This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)


why do we need to readline() often before we start doing anything else with the opened file? 

you can assign multiple methods to one variable, they are divided based on .  
ds = line.replace('>', '').split()[0]

paxilfile1 = open('paxillus.fna', 'r')
paxilfile2 = open('paxillusid.fna', 'w')
for line in paxilfile1:
    if line.startswith('>'):
        ids = line.replace('>', '').split()[0]
        paxilfile2.write(ids + "\n")        
paxilfile2.close()

#%%
#2
paxilfile1 = open('paxillus.fna', 'r')
paxilfile2 = open('paxillusGC.fna', 'w')

seq=[]
for line in paxilfile1:
    if "GC" in line:
        total_l = len(line)
        GCs = line.count("GC")
        GC_cont = (GCs / total_l*100)
        round(GC_cont,2).str(GC_cont)
        seq.append(GC_cont)
        paxilfile2.write(GC_cont)        
        #print("GC%: ", seq, "%")
paxilfile2.close()
