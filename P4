File Modes in Python

Following are various modes in Python
Mode 	Description
'r' 	This is the default mode. It Opens file for reading.
'w' 	This Mode Opens file for writing.   -- this erases the contents of the file if there's any before opening it on python!
'x' 	Creates a new file. If file already exists, the operation fails.
'a' 	Open file in append mode.
If file does not exist, it creates a new file.
't' 	This is the default mode. It opens in text mode.
'b' 	This opens in binary mode.
'+' 	This will open a file for reading and writing (updating)


why do we need to readline() often before we start doing anything else with the opened file? 

Because: Use file.readlines() to create a list where each element is a line from the file

you can assign multiple methods to one variable, they are divided based on .  
ds = line.replace('>', '').split()[0]
